# Text-and-Graph-Mining-for-Restaurant-Review-Classification

## Overview
This project leverages text and graph mining techniques to classify restaurant reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories and explores word relationships within a review using graph-based analysis. The project outlines the data processing steps, including cleaning and preparation, and the use of various libraries for tasks such as tokenization and feature extraction. Different machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest are applied and their performance is evaluated and visualized. Finally, the project demonstrates how to represent the relationship between words in a single review using a graph structure.

## Data Details
The dataset used is from a private source and initially contained 2500 instances (reviews) and 2 features. The two features are:
- Text: contains the actual review text in Arabic language.
- Class: an integer indicating the category of the review. The categories are: Positive (1), Neutral (0) or Negative (2).

## Code
You can find the project code in the Notebook.ipynb file.
